# Frik Frak 🇨🇻

A game inspired by **Frik Frak**, a traditional game from Cape Verdean culture.

When I was a child, I remember drawing the game field on the ground to play.  
Today, inspired by that memory and by our culture, I developed this game in digital format to preserve and share that experience.

## ✨ About the project

This project is a digital version of **Frik Frak**, recreated with **Flutter**, with support for different game modes:

- 👥 **2 Players (PvP)**
- 🤖 **Player vs Computer**
  - Easy
  - Hard

The game keeps the essence of the traditional version:
- Each player places **3 pieces** on the board
- If nobody wins in that phase, the **movement phase** begins
- Players move their pieces until someone aligns 3 and wins

---

## 🎮 Game Rules

### 1) Placement phase
- Each player places **3 pieces** on the board (X or O)

### 2) Movement phase
- If nobody wins after placing the pieces, players start **moving** their pieces on the board

### 3) Victory
- The winner is the player who manages to **align 3 pieces**

## ⚙️ Movement Modes

The game includes two movement rules:

- **Adjacent** (more classic): pieces can only move to connected/neighboring cells
- **Free**: pieces can move to any empty cell

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Flutter**
- **Dart**
- UI with **Material Design**

## 📱 Platforms

This app was developed with Flutter and can run on:

- ✅ Android

- ✅ Web
- ✅ Windows (desktop) *(for testing/development)*

> **Note:** Building for iOS requires a Mac with Xcode.
